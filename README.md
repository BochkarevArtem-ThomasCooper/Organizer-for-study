# Organizer-for-study

That desktop application should help user to manage selfaducational process.

Main purposes are:
1. Place to make and store notes.
2. All e-books (you added to "reading now") acsessable from the app. That is very useful if you have a lot of files with aducational books, with not always proper names 
(like 31313091891.pdf or quck_s_to_py.pdf), and they just piled up in some dir on your computer, and you never have time to organaze them, but you get's destracted by that
mess every time you going down to that dir to open the book you using now.
3. I belive in 1000h theory. So mesuring the amount of time, that I've spent on studing some subject, motivates me.
